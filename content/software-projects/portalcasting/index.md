The portalcasting package provides a model development, deployment, and evaluation system for forecasting how ecological systems change through time, with a focus on a widely used long-term study of mammal population and community dynamics, the Portal Project. It combines the Portal Data Repository and portalr data management package in a pipeline to automate weekly forecasting. Forecasts are archived on GitHub and Zenodo. The Portal Forecasting website provides a dynamic view of the results.
