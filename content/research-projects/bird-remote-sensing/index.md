We are developing computer vision based approaches to automatically detecting and identifying birds to species from airbone imagery.
We are also developing algorithms to identify nests and estimate nest success from repeated airborne flights.
We are using these tools for monitoring purposes in the Everglades, but developing them to be broadly useful for airborne bird monitoring in general.
