An suite of open-source databases of containing information on the life history traits and morphology of mammals, birds, and reptiles. There are three primary datasets:

* An amniote life‚Äêhistory database to perform comparative analyses with birds, mammals, and reptiles with data on 29 life-history parameters, containing at least one life-history parameter for 21,322 species of birds, mammals, and reptiles. [[Data](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3563457.v1), [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1890/15-0846R.1)]
* Life history characteristics of placental nonvolant mammals. [[Data](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3523109.v1), [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1890/02-9002)]
* Body mass of Late Quaternary mammals [[Data](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.3523112.v1), [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1890/02-9003)]
