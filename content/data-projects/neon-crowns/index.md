An open-source data set of individual-level crown detections from remote sensing for 100 million trees at 37 sites across the United States surveyed by the National Ecological Observatory Networkâ€™s Airborne Observation Platform. Each tree crown is represented by a bounding box and includes information on the height, crown area, and spatial location of the tree.
