This is an open educational resources on how to manage and providing access to data under continual active collection. It provides detailed step-by-step instructions for how to use R, git, GitHub Actions, and Zenodo to 1) perform quality assurance and control; 2) import, restructure, version, and archive data; and 4) automate most steps in the data pipeline to reduce the time and effort required by researchers. The workflow leverages tools from software development, including version control and continuous integration, to create a modern data management system that automates the pipeline.
