Google Summer of Code (GSOC) provides support for people interested in learning to improve their software development skills and contributing to open source projects to be work with established open source teams over the summer. Every year weecology mentors junior software developers on a number of our open source projects as part of this program. Our lead software developer, [Henry Senyondo](/author/henry-senyondo/), also helps run the larger NumFOCUS GSOC program that provides this training across an array of open source scientific software projects. Students who have participated in GSOC with us have gone on to careers at Amazon, Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs, and DataPane.
