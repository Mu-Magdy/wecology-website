Maya is an undergraduate student in Wildlife Ecology and Conservation. She is currently studying the dynamics of desert plants in the [Portal project](https://portal.weecology.org/). She is interested in how shrub cover responds to long-term weather conditions and the presence of grazing at various spatial scales in the desert Southwest.
